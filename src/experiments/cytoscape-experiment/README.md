# Findings:
1. Quite a good library overall, seems to have a lot of functionality. Managed to implement what I intended
1. A bit complicated positioning graphs, so far "breadthfirst" layout with setting a root worked best. Quite hard to get it right, because with most layouts edges end up on top of each other or all nodes end up in the same line or they are distributed in a random unexpected way.
