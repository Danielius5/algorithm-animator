# Timelog

* PROJECT NAME
* YOUR NAME

* SUPERVISOR NAME

## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 1

### 20 Sep 2023

* *1.5 hour* Set up pre-commit githook to remind me update timelog on every commit

### 21 Sep 2023

* *1.0 hour* Read Algorithmics 1 slides and other online materials about DFA's and redo exercises from Algorithmics 1
* *3.0 hours* Experimented building a static DFA using Cytoscape JS.
* *1.0 hours* Experimented building a static DFA using Sigma.js
* *0.5 hours* Experimented building a static DFA using React Flow
* *1.0 hours* Experimented building a static DFA using Mermaid JS
* *0.5 hours* Added Mermaid JS to a new React project
* *2.5 hours* Read about converting regular expressions to DFA and started trying to implement an algorithm to build a syntax tree out of regex
* *1.0 hours* Wrote weekly report

### 4 Oct 2023
* *1.0 hour* Try to do first  steps on converting regex to syntax tree
* *5.0 hour* Developed a basic UI to create a DFA

### 13 Oct 2023
* *1.0 hour* Change styles to flexbox, get rid of input for state name 
* *5.0 hours* Made it possible to build graph from UI and animate in a basic way (emphasising states and transitions) as well as showed whether the hardcoded text was accepted or rejected
* *3.0 hours* Started working on converting regex to ∈-NFA. Basic regex (no parentheses, "or" with only one char) can be converted to NFA.

### 24 Oct 2023
* *15.0 hours* Past weeks worked on converting regex to ∈-NFA. Unfortunately I did not commit as the solution was always half-working. Now it seems reasonably well-behaved and I want this state as backup.
* *3.0 hours* Looked at algorithm to convert ∈-NFA to DFA as well as tried to improve animation (work in progress)
* *1.0 hours* Implemented ∈-NFA transition table
* *5.0 hours* Implemented DFA transition table and built DFA
* *0.5 hours* Added empty set symbol

### 9 Nov 2023
* *1.5 hours* Corrected bug of multiple branches with the same characted for failing state for "ab*"
