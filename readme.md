# Finite State Automaton Animator

This project aims to help you visualise the creation and animation of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). More detailed [readme.md](./src/readme.md) and [manual.md](./src/manual.md) files are provided in the src folder containing the full details of how to run test and use the application.

The application is deployed to [https://danielius5.github.io/algorithm-animator/](https://danielius5.github.io/algorithm-animator/).
