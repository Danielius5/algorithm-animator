# Finite State Automaton Animator

This project aims to help you visualise the creation and animation of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). A more detailed readme.md file is provided [in the src folder](./src/readme.md) containing the full details of how to run and test the application.

The application is accessible at [https://danielius5.github.io/algorithm-animator/](https://danielius5.github.io/algorithm-animator/).
